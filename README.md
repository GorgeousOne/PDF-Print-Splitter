# PDF-Print-Splitter

When splitting a big PDF into smaller pieces for printing it's important to get the paper borders and overlap between pages right.
This is why I created what other people created before but I wanted to try anyway:

In this GUI program you can easily split up a big PDF into many small pages with custom margins and overlaps.
You can also add thin guide lines for easier sticking together :)
